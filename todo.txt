1. Create connection to IDGB and display data in JSON in console
    - Create library component then gameCard component
    - Get JSON data and display on gameCard
2. Create Topbar and search element + login 
    - Login should be oAuth but built freehand, no Firebase
    - CRUD will be the same
3. Homepage will show most recently played game and 5 other games from player library


NOTE: Will need to load information on login about which games are owned and on which platform.
This should load before the player sees their library. Could do it with dummy data and a setTimeout.
First platforms to include:
    - Steam
    - PS4 + 5
    - Current and last gen Xbox

Platforms to add:
    - GoG
    - Epic



Later Nice to Haves:
1. Show all trophies won
2. Show which difficulties have been completed (have to figure out how exactly)
3. Ability to buy the game and show all prices with the best deal showing first
